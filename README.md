# E-commerce simple app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

### Used context to store the cart
### Added a couple of tests for Products and ProductItem components
### Used semantics and added aria-label to button that don't contain text
